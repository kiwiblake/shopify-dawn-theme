            "question": "Do I need both estrogen and progesterone?",
            "answer": "<p>If you have an intact uterus (you haven't had a hysterectomy), you will need both estrogen and progesterone.

Many women take MHT for several years, and some continue for longer.</p><p style='margin-top: 0.5rem;'>Regular reviews with your healthcare provider (typically annually) will help ensure MHT remains the right choice for you. The decision to continue, adjust, or stop MHT should be made jointly with your doctor.</p>"
